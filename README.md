## Introduction
The Invoice Generator is a dynamic invoicing solution designed to provide flexibility and ease of use. This project enables users to generate invoices tailored to their specific needs. Whether you need to change fields, customize templates, or adapt calculations, this application has you covered.

At first glance, it may appear simple, but as you delve into the code and implement the application, you'll discover its complexity and the numerous functions and logic it offers. The system ensures that any change in a field automatically reflects in all calculations.

This project also supports the generation of invoices in PDF format, and XML functionality is in progress. Your contributions are welcome to make this project even more valuable.

I recommended that you download the PDF at zoom level 125. If you choose to download it at a different zoom level, the file is inappropriate. I realize that this is not correct, but I'm working on it. If you're interested, please make this project more appropriate with me.
